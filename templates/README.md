postfix mail transport configs
=========

Configuration files for postfix mail transports

Requirements
------------

These files are pushed from ansible. Don't modify them on the server. The proper place to modify them is in the ansible repository for the specific mail transport instances that you want to configure. Don't add configs to the postfix-mail-transport ansible role unless they should go on every server, regardless of purpose.
